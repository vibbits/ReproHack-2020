## 5. On the day

### 5.1 First things first

**Code of conduct:** As all ReproHack events, we strive to make this event open and inclusive to all. As such the event is governed by the [ReproHack Code of Conduct](https://github.com/reprohack/reprohack-hq/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and you should read it before participating. By participating, you are expected to uphold this code.

**Authors:** We encourage authors to be available for participants to reach out to for guidance or even just to say hello!

## 5.2 Planning for today:

**1. Paper review**
- Have a look at the papers available for reproduction on the [hackmd](https://hackmd.io/o3GZZhRORCOq6HGOLkyg3A). 

**2. Project registration and team formation**
- Feel free to work on your own if you prefer, but 
- We highly recommend to work together and discuss your experiences with fellow participants as you work.
- Register your project & team: add your details to the [hackmd](https://hackmd.io/o3GZZhRORCOq6HGOLkyg3A)

**3. Reprohack!**
- Follow any instructions/documentation associated with the papers and try and reproduce the data analysis. 
- As you work through your paper, keep in mind the following points: Findability, Accessibility, Reproducibility, Documentation and Reusability.
- We encourage you to use the event hackpad to record general findings you wish to share with everyone. 

**4. Mid-point regroup**
- Which paper have you selected? Briefly describe what it's about.
- Briefly describe the approach to reproducibility the paper has taken.
- Anything in particular you like about the paper's approach so far?
- Anything you're having difficulty with? Maybe there is someone that can help you?

**5. Feedback to the authors**
- Complete the [feedback form](https://forms.gle/uHxV588JztGuiB887) for the authors of the paper
- We expect that any feedback and criticism on authorsâ€™ work is expressed in a constructive, friendly and respectful manner.


**6. Final regroup**
- How was it? Any final comments?
- What will you take home? 
- If there's time, tackle some discussion topics from the hackmd
- Feedback for the organizers. 

**Additional activities**: 
You might want to consider attempting to replicate the results, for example, if the code is in R consider translating the analysis to python and examining whether you are getting the same results. Such a contribution would be appropriate for publication in the ReScience C journal! Have a look at the journals website for further details.

Should you finish reproducing your paper quickly, feel free to explore the work more deeply. For example, you could try and run additional analyses, create new plots or even combine materials with your own or other open materials available on the web!

Should you produce any additional materials relating to your reproduction during the session, we ask that you share it publicly and add any links to such materials to the hackpad.

This hackaton is based on the work of the ReproHack movement in the Netherlands which you can find at https://github.com/reprohack. In favor of a more Life Sciences related edition, this material was slightly adapted.
