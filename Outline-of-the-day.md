## 5. On the day

### 5.1 First things first

**Code of conduct:** As all ReproHack events, we strive to make this event open and inclusive to all. As such the event is governed by the [ReproHack Code of Conduct](https://github.com/reprohack/reprohack-hq/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and you should read it before participating. By participating, you are expected to uphold this code.

**Authors:** We encourage authors to be available for participants to reach out to for guidance or even just to say hello!

**Participants:**
1. Project review and team formation

  -  We’ll start with a brief review of the papers proposed and then form into teams. Feel free to work on your own if you prefer but we highly recommend you discuss your experiences with fellow participants as you work.

2. Select and register a paper
  - Each paper will have a [hackpad](https://hackmd.io/) enabling recording the outcomes
  - Add your details in the participants section of the hackpad so we have a complete list of participants.
  - Register your team and paper by logging the title of the selected paper and the name(s) of the reviewer(s) in the hackpad. You can use the following template:

**Paper:** *Title of the paper*
**Reviewers:** *Reviewer 1, Reviewer 2, etc.*

```
**Paper:** *Title of the paper reproduced*
**Reviewers:** *Reviewer 1, Reviewer 2 etc.*
```

**Work on the paper:**
Follow any instructions/documentation associated with the papers and try and reproduce the data analysis. As you work through your paper, keep in mind the following points: Findability, Accessibility, Reproducibility, Documentation and Reusability. Feel free to use the event hackpad to record general findings you wish to share with the group.

You might want to consider attempting to replicate the results, for example, if the code is in R consider translating the analysis to python and examining whether you are getting the same results. Such a contribution would be appropriate for publication in the ReScience C journal! Have a look at the journals website for further details.

Should you finish reproducing your paper quickly, feel free to explore the work more deeply. For example, you could try and run additional analyses, create new plots or even combine materials with your own or other open materials available on the web!

Should you produce any additional materials relating to your reproduction during the session, we ask that you share it publicly and add any links to such materials to the hackpad.

4. Leave feedback for the authors

We encourage to fill in a feedback form on the paper that you picked after the hackaton. We expect that any feedback and criticism on authors’ work is expressed in a constructive, friendly and respectful manner.

Please complete the [feedback form](google.be). Please also remember to be respectful and constructive. Here’s an example of feedback to authors.
Take notes for yourself.

This hackaton is based on the work of the ReproHack movement in the Netherlands which you can find at https://github.com/reprohack. In favor of a more Life Sciences related edition, this material was slightly adapted.
